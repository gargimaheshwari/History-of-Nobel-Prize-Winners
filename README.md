The Nobel Prize is one of the world's most well known awards. Aside from the honor, prestige and substantial prize money the recipient also gets a gold medal showing Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896) who established the prize. Every year it's given to scientists and scholars in the categories chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace.


The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901. At the time the Prize was very Eurocentric and given out mostly to men. How has this trend changed, if at all? That's what I'm trying to find out.
